        <p>Baby teeth are much smaller than permanent teeth. Plus, the shape is more on the square-ish side, which is

            A dental filling is common for toddlers and children who have one or more cavities. Fillings can take place
            on permanent teeth, as well as on baby teeth. During the procedure, the dentist removes the tooth decay and
            then fills the hole with a white composite or metal material.

        <h1>How do I care for my child's primary teeth?</h1>

        <p>Proper dental care begins before a child's first tooth appears. Each day, run a clean, damp washcloth or an
            infant toothbrush over their gums to clear away harmful bacteria.
            When a child's teeth begin to come in, follow these tips:

            Brush their teeth with an infant toothbrush. Use water and a tiny bit of infant toothpaste that's
            recommended by your doctor or dentist. Talk with your dentist about fluoride.
            When your baby's teeth touch, you can begin flossing between them.
            When kids are about age 2, start teaching them to spit while brushing. Don't give water to swish and spit
            because they could swallow toothpaste.
